* The thread page will auto scroll to the bottom once loaded so that the latest message will always be shown first.

* Threads with new message(s) (see user1 in image below) will have a blue bullet beside the recipient's username.
* Once a thread (see user3 in image below) is clicked, it is considered read and the blue bullet won't show up.
* The threads are sorted by the date & time of last message received/sent.
